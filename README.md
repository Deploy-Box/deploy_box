# Deploy Box 🚀📦

**Deploy Box** is a platform built to make **deploying, managing, and scaling full-stack web applications** simple and stress-free. Whether you're a solo developer or part of a growing team, Deploy Box aims to remove the friction from cloud infrastructure so you can focus on building great products — not managing DevOps.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Deploy Box is designed to:

- Provide **pre-configured, production-ready stacks** (e.g., MERN, MEAN, Django + React, etc.)
- Offer **secure, cloud-hosted environments** right out of the box
- Integrate with **best-in-class database providers** like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and others
- Help developers **skip the boilerplate** and get straight to shipping custom features

## 🛠️ Current Status

This project is actively under development.

Our goal is to offer:

- A CLI for spinning up and managing your stacks
- A web interface for browsing, purchasing, and customizing stacks
- Documentation to support development, scaling, and deployment workflows

The CLI and documentation are currently being rebuilt. In the meantime, feel free to explore the repo or contribute to the vision.

## 💡 Want to Help?

If you're interested in:

- Contributing to the CLI or web interface
- Building and sharing stack templates
- Offering feedback on infrastructure workflows

Feel free to open an issue or reach out via the Discussions tab.

More updates (and a working CLI) coming soon. Stay tuned!
